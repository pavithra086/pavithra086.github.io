abstract class vs interface
-> What is the difference between an abstract class and a interface, if a class
has at least one abstract
method, then that class needs to be marked as abstract class, if not the
class wont compile any class
that extends abstract class should then provide the implementation for these
abstract methods in a
abstract class.
-> If not, that class should also be marked as it abstract class.
Abstract class can have any number of methods with implementation, but as
soon as it has one abstract
method, it becomes abstract class.
-> Whereas in interfaces all the methods are abstract.
-> The class that implements the interface should provide the implementation
for those abstract methods.
A class can implement any number of interfaces, whereas it can only extend
one abstract class
