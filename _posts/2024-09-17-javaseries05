Can a class implement two interfaces with the same method
-> Can a class implement two interfaces with the same exact method signature?
-> Yes, here I have an interface called Car, which has the go method, which is
void and also a avoid
stop method.
-> And I also have a driverless interface with sit down and relax method and a
void go method, the same
go method we have in the car interface as well.
-> Now the Honda class implements both the car and the driverless.
It has no issues because it has to provide a implementation for the go
method.
-> So it overrides the go method and it provides the implementation.
So we don't have the typical Diemen problem, which we see in case of
extending classes.
