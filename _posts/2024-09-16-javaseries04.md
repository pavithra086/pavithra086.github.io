title: java series 04 - multiple inheritance
---
 Why is multiple inheritance no supported
-> Is multiple inheritance not supported in Java, multiple inheritance is not
supported because if we
inherit from two classes, which have the same method, for example, here we
have the rich confused kid class,
which extends father and mother, which have the same method money.
-> Now, when we invoke the money method using the rich, confused child's
instance or object, the compiler
will not know which money method it should bind to or which money meant that
it should invoke.
That is one reason why multiple inheritance is not supported will get a
compile time issue.
-> If we try to do this to make things even more complex, we have the classic
diamond problem that we
see in languages like C++.
-> If we have a grandparent class which also has a money method, then the
compiler will find it even more
difficult to decide which money method should be invoked when the rich
confused states object is used to
invoke the money method.
